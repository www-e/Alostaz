General Concepts & Technical Best Practices
Always validate inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
Use version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.
Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication.
Use meaningful variable and function names for better readability.
Comment code to explain complex logic or decisions.
Handle exceptions properly to prevent application crashes.
Use logging to track application behavior and debug issues.
Optimize database queries for better performance. (we are using supabase)
Use caching to reduce load times and improve user experience.
API Calls & Handling
Use HTTPS for secure API communications.
Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse.
Handle API errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
Use API keys or tokens for authentication.
Cache API responses to reduce load on the server.
Coding & Context Awareness
Understand the problem domain before writing code.
Consider the target audience and their needs.
Use design patterns to solve common problems.
Write code that's easy to extend and maintain.
Use linters and formatters to enforce coding standards.
Mandtory : Analysis-First Approach
Mandtory : Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
Consider multiple solutions and choose the best one.
Think about edge cases and potential failures.
Plan the code structure before starting to write.
Response Guidelines
Provide clear and concise answers.
Avoid jargon unless necessary.
Explain technical concepts in simple terms.
Offer additional resources for further learning.
Be honest about limitations and uncertainties.
Performance Optimization
Optimize algorithms for time and space complexity.
Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
Minimize network requests and data transfers.
Use asynchronous programming for non-blocking operations.
Optimize database indexes for faster queries.
Modular & Folder Structure
Organize code into logical modules or components.
Use a consistent naming convention for files and folders.
Separate concerns to improve maintainability.
Clean Code Principles
Write code that's easy to read and understand.
Use whitespace and indentation consistently.
Avoid magic numbers and strings; use constants instead.
Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
SEO Optimizations (For Web Development)
Optimize page load times for better user experience.
Use meta tags and descriptions for better search visibility.
Implement structured data for rich search results.
Ensure mobile-friendliness for better rankings.
Product Readiness
Write comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
Plan for scalability and future growth.
